# Hello.TalkToJira  

This is a simple Chatbot to talk to your Jira System.

It uses **Azure OpenAI** Large Language Models. It runs in your Console.

Like all my "Hello"-projects, this is a "Hello World" version of a chat bot, meaning that it is meant to be an experiment and not meant to be for production.

## Features  
- Chat with your Jira Instance from your Console  
- Switch between different models (more precisely: switch between different deployments in Azure AI) with the `/model` command.  
- Chat history; length of history can be set with `/history` command.  
- Get help with `/help` command
